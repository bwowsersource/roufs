# Roufs: Simplified Routing for Node.js

Roufs (pronounced "roofs") is a straightforward and practical routing solution for Node.js API frameworks, inspired by the routing approach used in Next.js. This module is designed to work seamlessly with Express.js, but it can be easily adapted for use with other popular frameworks as well.


## Features

- Automatic route mapping
- Supports parameterized routes
- Minimal configuration required

## Getting Started

To get started with Roufs in an express project, follow these steps:

1.  Install Roufs:

    ```bash
    npm install roufs
    ```
1. Create your route handler modules in the desired directory structure. For example:

    ```
        -   ./routes
        ├── index.js
        ├── authors
        │   ├── GET.js
        │   └── POST.js
        └── books
            ├── index.js
            └── [bookid].js
    ```

1. Integrate Roufs into your Express.js server in your `index.js` file:

    ```js

        const express = require("express");
        const roufs = require("roufs");
        const app = express();

        // Specify the path to your route handler modules
        app.use(roufs('./routes'));

        app.listen(5001, () => {
            console.log("Server is up and running on port 5001!");
        });
    ```

Defining Routes
---------------

Define your route handlers in separate modules within the `./routes` directory (relative to root of project). You can use simple functions or objects with HTTP method-specific functions to define your handlers. For example:

```js
// Example 1: ./routes/authors/GET.js
module.exports = (req, res) => res.send("Response");

// Example 2: ./routes/books/index.js
module.exports = {
    GET: (_, res) => res.send("GET:/books"),
    POST: (_, res) => res.send("POST:/books")
}

// Example 3: ./routes/books/[bookid].js
module.exports = {
    GET: (req, res) => res.send(req.params), // params = { bookid: "path-param" }
};
```

Dynamic Routes
--------------

Roufs supports dynamic routes. You can create parameterized routes like `/books/[bookid]`, and the module will handle them automatically.

How Roufs Works
---------------

Roufs uses a clever mechanism to traverse your route directory structure and dynamically match incoming requests to their corresponding handlers. It simplifies route management by abstracting away the complexities.
